# rhovue

> Official web front end for [rhobooru](https://github/com/rhobooru/rhobooru)

rhovue is a Single Page Application built on `Nuxt`->`Vue`->`Vuetify` that offers an attractive, responsive, static-hostable front end for any rhobooru server.

rhovue offers 100% feature parity with the rhobooru API and is the most stable way to interact with rhobooru and [rhobot](https://github/com/rhobooru/rhobot). rhovue and rhobooru features are developed in tandem and releases will always have the same [major].[minor] version numbers, according to semantic versioning.

For more details on the rhobooru project, please visit the [main repository](https://github.com/rhobooru/rhobooru).
